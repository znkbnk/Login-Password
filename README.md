Project: Login and Password

The "Login and Password" project is a simple
React application that allows users to enter
their username and password in a login form.
When the form is submitted, the entered username
and password values are logged to the console. 

Step 1: Set Up the Project

-  Create a new directory for your project.
-  Open a code editor of your choice and 
navigate to the project directory.

Step 2: Create the Login Form Component

-  Create a new file called LoginForm.js.
-  Define a functional component named LoginForm.
-  Inside the LoginForm component,
create two state variables: username and password.
These variables will hold the user's
input for the username and password fields.
-  Render a form element with an onSubmit
event handler that prevents the default
form submission behavior.
-  Inside the form, render an h1 element
with the text "Login".
-  Render two label elements for the username
and password fields.
-  Inside each label, render an input element
with the appropriate type attribute
(e.g., text for the username field,
password for the password field).
-  Bind the value of each input element to the
corresponding state variable
(e.g., value={username} for the username input,
value={password} for the password input).
-  Define event handler functions for the onChange
events of the input elements. These functions
should update the corresponding state 
variable with the user's input.
-  Render a submit button inside the form element.

Step 3: Render the Login Form Component

-  Create a new file called App.js.
-  Define a functional component named App.
-  Inside the App component, render an
instance of the LoginForm component.
-  Export the App component as the default
export of the file.

Step 4: Use React to Render the App

-  Open the index.js file.
-  Import the React and ReactDOM libraries.
-  Import the App component from App.js.
-  Use the ReactDOM.render method to render
the App component inside the root element
of your HTML document (usually with an id of root).

Step 5: Test and Refine

-  Open a web browser and navigate to the local
development server where your React app is running.
-  Verify that the login form is rendered correctly.
-  Enter a username and password in the
input fields and submit the form.
-  Verify that the form submission is handled correctly
(e.g., display the entered username and password in
the console or perform any other desired logic).
-  Refine the login form component or add additional
features as desired, such as validation,
authentication, or error handling.
